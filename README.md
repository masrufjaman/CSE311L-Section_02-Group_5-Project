## Purpose of the project:

Shopping has long been considered as a refreshment by many. Shopping in online became a recreational activity of life. The purpose of online shopping is to save time, save money. Through online shopping, one can save his/her valuable time. One can watch and select things he/she wants to buy. Through online shopping we can also save our money because prices are less than market prices and we receive our bought things at our home. This is the main reason of developing web based online shopping system.
In this project, we build frontend part of a Super Shop Management System from scratch. At first there will be a home page and from there we can visit other pages. Here it contain the regular super shop product details such as food, home appliances. It will also contain the prices, quantity of products. And this will be an user friendly website. So, everyone can use it with ease.
